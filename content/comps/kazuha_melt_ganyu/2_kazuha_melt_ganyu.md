pros:
  - Big Damage Charged Attack Numbers
cons:
  - Insanely High Energy Costs 
  - Timing is extremely tight to do 5 Charged Attacks and 4 is around 15% DPS decrease
  - Kazuha's Pyro Application in single-target is incredibly unreliable. Zhonglis E and Ganyu's E will gurantee that you loss control.
  - The setup is quite senstive and easy to mess up. 
  - If the enemy is outside of Kauzha's Burst, no Pyro app. 
  - Using 2 of the most highly demanded supports in the game, and Zhongli on top. All for this.

# **Notes**
Though each individial Charged Attack deals a lot of damage, Melt Ganyu with Kazuha suffers from several major issues. The setup is difficult, though this can be overcome with practice.
<br></br>

It has extremely high Energy requirements, requiring an Energy Recharge Sands along with Energy weapons on both Kazuha and Bennett.
<br></br>

While it is possible to do 5 Charged Attacks, most people will only be able to do 4. In the event you can only do 4, you should attempt to do a second Benentt E in order to recuperate damage with Energy. This requires him to catch the last ticks of his Burst to reduce his Skill cooldown. This isn't too hard to do with a bit of practice though. 
<br></br>

The final, and possibly biggest problem, is in single-target, Kazuha's Pyro application is unreliable. He applies just enough Pyro to Melt all of Ganyu's Charged Attacks, but the addition of Zhongli's Pillar or Ganyu's E can nullify this. However, in AoE, this does get better with additional Pyro Swirls, but Melt Ganyu is generally a single-target orientated team.
