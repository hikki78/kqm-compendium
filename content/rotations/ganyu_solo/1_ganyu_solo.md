# **Notes**

Gorou visits Liyue to witness the tactical genius Zhongli used to win the Archon War:
<br></br>
"Ganyu go kill."
 <br></br>
Qiqi gets to watch. 
<br></br>
The basis of this team is very simple. Zhongli makes a shield and Ganyu shoots stuff. Turns out this is really effective. 
<br></br>
Qiqi and Gorou are never used in this rotation, only here to supply resonance. If you wanted them to do something, you could give Gorou Archaic Petra and move Zhongli to Tenacity, and Qiqi can use Ocean Hued Clam. That said thats not a huge DPS gain.
<br></br>
While Ganyu's Burst does contribute significantly to this rotation with her A4's Cryo Damage Bonus, building Energy Recharge at the cost of offensive stats is not worth it.
<br></br>
With enough practice, you will get used to when Zhongli should refresh his shield. 
<br></br>

# **Rotation Notes**

**Rotation:**  
Zhongli hE  
Ganyu Go Kill  
<br></br>
Ganyu should use her Burst and skill off cooldown and perform her Charged Attacks when they're on cooldown. 
<br></br>

**Recording Disclaimers:** Burst was not used as these enemies produced excess energy and is not applicable to all situations so Burst was held this time. In practice you should Burst whenever it is possible unless it needs to be saved. 

<br></br>
**Sim Disclaimer:** The sims frame perfect gameplay.
