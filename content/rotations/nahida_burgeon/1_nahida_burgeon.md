# **Notes**
Bennett can run Fav Sword. You can do this team with an EM weapon on Jean and without C2 Nahida, but that's significantly less fun.  

Nahida can just run whatever you have.  

Other notes:  
- Loosest definition of a Burgeon team. Hopefully Jean procs them all.  
- This is a Nahida C2 team. The point is that Jean procs Favonius Sword energy via Burgeon when she casts her Elemental Burst into her Elemental Skill. There is literally no other reason why to play this.  
- Tartaglia stops doing his NA combos when Bennett's buff expires. The timing ends up lining up pretty well.  
- Tartaglia Burst makes blooms due to it being 2U worth of Hydro. It also Vaporizes on the burning.  
- Consistent Viridescent Venerer is not reliable with Nahida around.  

As noted above, a big con is circle impact. I recommend this team if you like dopamine overdosing yourself though.
