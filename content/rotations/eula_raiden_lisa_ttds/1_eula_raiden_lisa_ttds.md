# **Notes**
A dual carry team that employs Lisa's ability to pass the Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer buff to Eula while also providing DEF Shred on enemies with her Elemental Burst. A significant portion of damage is done near the end of the rotation when Eula's Lightfall Sword pops and Raiden activates her Burst. This can be used on enemies that have a limited window of vulnerability to output a concentrated amount of Burst damage.

# **Energy Requirements**
Eula - 154%  
Raiden - 211%  
Lisa - 132%  
Diona - 144%

# **Rotation Notes**
