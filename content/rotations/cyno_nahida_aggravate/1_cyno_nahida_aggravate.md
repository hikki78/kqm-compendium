# **Notes**  
The main point of this team is to deal high amounts of aggravate and electro damage with Cyno during his burst duration, while also dealing off-field aggravate and spread damage with Fischl and Nahida. Cyno's artifact set, Thundering Fury, requires Zhongli to provide a long lasting shield to get his optimal attack string off uninterrupted. Using Nahida tap E in a single target situation compared to hold E can slightly reduce rotation times from 24 seconds to 23 seconds. No constellations are required for the team to function, although Fischl C6 is greatly recommended to extend her uptime and increase her off-field damage.

## Approximate Energy Requirements:  
Cyno: 100-110%  
Nahida: 120-140%  
Fischl: 100%  
Zhongli: 100%
