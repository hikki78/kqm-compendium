# **Notes**

This is a standard Diluc Vaporize team with Xingqiu, Bennett, and Zhongli. Damage is basically only from Diluc and Xingqiu. Dash cancels are important to fit in a few extra Normal Attacks to squeeze in extra DPS. Funnel Bennett's 2nd Elemental Skill to Diluc to lower his ER Requirement.

**Video + Extra Notes**
Video shows examples of some dash cancels that can be performed. Generally dash canceling Zhongli Hold E, Xingqiu E/Q, and Diluc N4 is best. Diluc N1's at the beginning of his field time to potentially trigger a Rain Sword. Whether he does or not depends on your swap speed, which is affected by ping.
