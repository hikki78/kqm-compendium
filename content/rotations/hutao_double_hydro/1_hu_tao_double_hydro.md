# **Notes**
 
As it is a Hu Tao team, it is obviously not the easiest comp to play. But due to the characters and the straight forward rotation, this is one of the easier teams to play for this character, while still delivering high amounts of damage. As one of Hu Tao's strongest teams, it is centered around maximizing Hydro application which Hu Tao uses to Vaporize and at the same time spreading the damage across all characters, the main damage dealers being Hu Tao, Yelan and Xingqiu. While Hu Tao is doing most of the damage, Yelan and Xingqiu together do almost as much, making them a reliable duo. Kazuha being the last slot, he helps with buffs, little amounts of damage and useful grouping and AoE.
