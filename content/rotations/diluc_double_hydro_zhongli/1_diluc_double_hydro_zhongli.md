# **Notes**

This is a variant of the Diluc Vaporize team, replacing Bennett with Yelan which sacrifices Diluc's personal damage for an increased share of damage by Yelan and Xingqiu. Zhongli can provide comfortable rotations through shielding, and damage buffs through Resistance Shred and the 4-Piece Tenacity of the Millelith ATK% buff.

# **ER Requirements**
Diluc - 130%  
Yelan - 180%  
Xingqiu - 200%  
Zhongli - 100%
