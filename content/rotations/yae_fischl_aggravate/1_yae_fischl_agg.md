# **Notes**
This calc is being made with keeping quite high investment in mind like Yae having Kagura and Kazuha having Xiphos' moonlight, on the flip side xiphos is only R1, so fav with high refinement(R3) will perform close enough to that and if we provide  Oathsworn Eye R5 to Yae instead then the team DPS becomes 'round bout 48k, which isn't much worse. Also ER requirement in the team is quite low because of Xiphos+fav+electro resonance but I still have included more ER subs to neutralize the overall builds. Keep in mind this teams performance increases quite a bit with gearing and constellation. 

# **Rotation Notes**  
**First Rotation:**  
Fischl E  
Kazuha hEp  
Yae EEE  
DMC E Q  
Kazuha Q hEp  
Fischl Q   
Yae Q  
**Subsequent Rotations:**
Yae EEE  
Kazuha hEp  
Fischl E  
DMC E Q  
Kazuha Q hEp  
Fischl Q  
Yae Q EEE  

Note - Rotations can change a lot with Widsith but Widsith calcs are too complicated to do for me -Hikki#7589
