# **Notes**  

A strong team made up of strong and synergistic units, especially in AoE where Kazuha's contribution through Swirls is greatly increased. Bennett provides a massive ATK buff and healing to the team as well as the Pyro application for Kazuha's Burst to absorb off of. Kazuha, in turn, provides a DMG% buff, 4 VV, CC, and high-damage Swirls and Overloads. These Overloads are enabled by Fischl's Electro application, with Ayato as a Hydro applicator to more easily maintain the Electro aura.
