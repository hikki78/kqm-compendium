# **Notes**

This calc is mostly F2P gear, C0 5-Stars, and R5 event/craftable weapons, the only exception being Shenhe and Venti's R3 Favonius weapons. Lower refinements still work but will bring more variance. This team excels in multi-target scenarios, especially if the enemy can be picked up by Venti's ultimate. While not being as accessible as other teams, as it contains four 5-Stars, it also doesn't use up any premiere 4-Star units, such as Bennett or Xingqiu, allowing you to run a very strong team with those units on the other side of the abyss.
<br></br>

Do note that these numbers are from a 2 freezable target scenario. In single-target, non freezable content (bosses like the PMA), this team's DPS and survivability scales down drastically, as you lose quadratic scaling on Ganyu ultimate, 20% CRIT Rate from blizzard strayer, and are left with only prototype amber as a source of healing/survivability.
<br></br>
Damage will go up second rotation onwards due to prototype crescent being active for Ganyu's Burst, and left over icicles from the previous rotation.
