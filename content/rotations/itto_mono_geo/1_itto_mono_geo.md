# **Notes**

This calc uses Free-to-Play gear on all units, with the exception of Favonius Lance on Zhongli, which can be replaced with Black Tassel. Itto's ER requirements can be higher depending on Particle RNG. Higher DMG combos on Itto can be used, but the one covered here is relatively hard. Visit https://keqingmains.com/itto/ to learn more about his combos. 4TotM on Zhongli can be dropped for a <5% DPS decrease.
