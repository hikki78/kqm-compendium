# **Notes**

There are two main goals for this team:	 
1) Generate cores consistently over time and use Kuki to trigger Hyperbloom.  
2) Proc Beidou's Burst Lightning DMG as many times as possible.	 
This lets us avoid any split scaling issues on units and means we don't have to worry about who is driving Beidou, as long as the timings match up to proc her Q.	Candace and DMC work together really well for this, since Candace ends up applying Hydro numerous times, but in a controlled manner to not overtake the Dendro aura like XQ would. Candace's normal string drives Beidou's Q really easily, so we use Candace on-field most.	

# **Rotation Notes**

**First Rotation:**  
Kuki E  
DMC E n1 Q  
Beidou E Q  
Candace n1Q n1 E n4  
DMC E n1  
Beidou E  
Kuki n1 Q  
Candace n3 E n4  
Loop  
  
This rotation can take a while to learn the swap order, but it ends up being pretty forgiving on which character you're on as long as you focus on proccing Beidou's Q.
