# **Notes**
Main appeal of this team is the auto targeted damage and consistent DPS. It does require the use of a small tech on Wanderer where the Windfavored state gets ended with his A4 Dash, allowing him to fall faster. This can be required if set up is slow due to Yae wanting to Burst with all 3 of her totems active. 
  
## Approximate Energy Requirements:  
Wanderer: 100-110%  
Yae: 140-150%  
Fischl: 100-110%  
Zhongli : N/A
