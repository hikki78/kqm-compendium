pros:
  - Strong Single-Target DPS
  - Multiple sources of damage
  - Xingqiu gets time on Bennett field during normal rotation, so all members get a chance to be healed during normal play
cons: 
  - Weaker AoE damage
  - Overloaded can knock enemies away
  - Uses highly contested units
  - Execution is harder than the classic Xiangling Bennett Xingqiu Raiden rotation
  - Utilizes additional Weapon (EL) or Constellations investment into Raiden less well.

# **Notes**

This team is very similar to the Classic Raiden National team, but uses a slightly modified rotation to allow Xingqiu to do a Bennett and C4 buffed E. However, this comes at the cost of some of Raiden's field time.
