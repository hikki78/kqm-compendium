pros:
  - Fantastic damage vs 2-3 targets
  - Damage is more consistent with Eula sacrificing personal damage in exchange for Beidou's contribution
  - Biedou's damage reduction with Diona's shielding gives enough durability to face tank most enemies 
cons:
  - One of the hardest Eula teams to play
  - Requires weaving Normal Attacks in-between skill casts to effectively use Beidou's damage
  - Has a longer rotation to memorize
  - Struggles when there is only one enemy

# **Notes**
This team excels in 2-3 target situations such as two Ruin Guards. There is also a strong emphasis on effectively weaving in Normal Attacks while executing the rotation to maximize Beidou's procs. This in turn makes the team pretty hard to pilot as it is punishing to miss Normal Attacks for building stacks and Beidou procs. In addition this team has a pretty long rotation that can be harder to memorize. Please note that Beidou's damage contribution shoots up from 13% to 27% when going from one target to two targets.

# **Energy Requirements**
Eula - 121%  
Raiden - 211%    
Beidou - 109%  
Diona - 131%  

# **Rotation Notes**
Raiden E > Beidou E Q > Diona Hold E Q > Eula N1 E N1 Q N1 E N4 D N2 Hold E N1 > Raiden Q 2N4C N2C (Repeat)

It is acceptable to use variations of Raiden's autoattacks such as N1C spam if 2N4C N2C is not comfortable. 

**Disclaimer:** human error can create rotation length differences. Solver was used to optimize substats; your personal substats are different.
