pros:
  - Fantastic damage vs 2-3 targets
  - Damage is more consistent with Eula sacrificing personal damage in exchange for Beidou's contribution
  - Biedou's damage reduction with Diona's shielding gives enough durability to face tank most enemies 
cons:
  - One of the harder Eula teams to play
  - Requires weaving Normal Attacks in-between skill casts to effectively use Beidou's damage
  - Struggles vs one target

# **Notes**
This team excels in 2-3 target situations such as two Ruin Guards. There is also a strong emphasis on effectively weaving in Normal Attacks while executing the rotation to maximize Beidou's procs. This in turn makes the team pretty hard to pilot as it is punishing to miss Normal Attacks for building stacks and Beidou procs. Please note that Beidou's damage contribution shoots up from 18% to 37% when going from one target to two targets.
